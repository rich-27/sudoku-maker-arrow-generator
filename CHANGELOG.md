## Planned

- Extend bent arrow syntax to incorporate:
  - `{qwxc}` for a double bend
  - `{<qad}` for double headed arrows
  - `{wsd}` for arrows that bend in the centre of the cell
  - `{xde}` for a 45Â° bend
    - How does this interact with cell walls?
    - Would likely need a special tip for diagonal wall connections (both corner and side)

[//]: # ([2.0.0] - 2025-10-??)

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- New bent arrow syntax:
  - `z:x` is now `{az}`, which is shorthand for `{aaz}`
  - The new format specifies `{{tail position}, {bend position}, {tip position}}`
  - This allows for new big bent arrows such as `{qec}`
  - After some use this feels a lot more intuitive
  - By default these arrows:
    - start from the adjacent cell wall
    - end in a tip

### Removed

- No type parameter needed in JSON specifications
  - Small arrows and bent arrows having distinct syntax means type can be inferred
